  <i> The first ever findings of a crystal structure inbetween the liquid gas interface and brownian motion observations in in liquid and gas. </i>
  <p>
    I started conducting nanoimaging research under the guidence of Dr. Gary Ren during the summer
    of 2014 at the Molecular Fundary at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We developed a microchamger
    that allowed us to observe the first ever visualization of phase changes, the liquid gas interface,
    and brownian motion at the mesoscale. Using EMAN, I also analyzed phase and partical properties by tracking particle movement
    and calculating each particle's of mean square displacement, speed, acceleration, and forces causing its movement. Our work
    has been submitted to <i>Nature</i> and is now under review. I was also awarded as a Siemens Semifinalist for this project.

  <i>Screening of peroxidase null Streptomyces that took up the antibiotic cassette</i>
  <p>
    I started conducting research at the Sello Lab at Brown University in the begining of June 2017. I disrupted
    the peroxidase gene in <i>Streptomyces</i> (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> model) bacteria through PCR Targeting and observed
    reduced bacterial resistance twoards cumene hydroperoxide stress, a naturally produced molecule by the immune system.
    Additionally, I have also disrupted the cyclic AMP gene in Streptomyces bacterial and conducted <i>in vitro</i> well microplate
    antimicrobial drug susceptibility tests via resazurin microtiter assay.

  <center><b>Nanoparticle Synthesis and Catalytic Design</b></center>
  <p>
    I joined the Sun Lab in the begining of September 2017 and began by syntehsizing monodisperse silver palladium and iron oxide
    nanoparticles for formic acid dehydrogenation. I am currently developing iron palladium nanoparticles for catalysis of dechlorination
    reactions, allowing it to be run at safe pressures and temperatures. To analyze the synthesized nanoparticles, I conduct organic reactions,
    testing their stability and catalytic ability, along with ICP spectroscopy, TEM, and X-Ray Diffraction to analyze their physical properties.

  <i> Testing of our first prototype, The Pursuit.</i>
  <p>
    At the begining of 2017, I helped start Cloud Agronomics, a solar powered UAV and
    data acquisition company, using our slef designed solar UAV and proprietary imaging technology
    for real time agricultural mapping that can provide instant data on crop health. We are also
    aiming to break the world record for the longest flight of a UAV under 50 lb, currently held by
    AtlantikSolar at 81 hours. We are selected to to represent Brown University to compete for the
    Hult Prize at the Ivy league and northeast regional competition in the spring of 2018, awarded
    first runner up for the Startup Storm Global Business Plan Competition, and third in the Inaugural
    Penn Aerospace Pitch Competition. We have been awarded the Brown Maker Grant, Brown Explore Grant,
    and are working with the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society and are currently in a partnership with US Solar Works.
    We also currently have advisors at Brown, NASA, Boeing, and Stanford.

  <i> First prototype of Louis.</i>
  <p>
    I created Louis, a visually impared assistant, that ouptus an analysis of one's immediate surrounding in braille.
    It uses a raspberry pi to take images of ones sarroundings. We take the analysis of these images and output them input
    into braille using the braille outputer I designed. It uses two stepper motors that can both traverse therough the
    braille blocks and also rotate them, creating a combination of letters and signals.

  <i> Hompage of NewsMap and projected news articles of Nasdaq around the world</i>
  <p>
    At HackMIT, I helped develop NewsMap.
    NewsMap utilizes global market visualization software to provide a real-time visualization of news reports mentioning companies across the world in over 65 languages.
    By customizing the tone and geographic data from these news reports, NewsMap provides simple, easily understood, and interactive graphics, representing historical and up-to-date data, along with a company's stock and financial performance metrics.
    This allows companies to quickly get fast, and reliable data on their international digital footprint, empowering them to make strategic and rewarding decisions.
    NewsMap won the award for best data visualization at HackMIT. You can visit Newsmap <a href="https://newsmap2017.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
